# Transmission

This is a wildcard plugin and can be named transmission_status or transmission_traffic.

## Status mode
Shows the number of torrents in each status: stopped, seeding, waiting, downloading and checking.

## Traffic mode
Generates a graph like if_, but only with the traffic generated by Transmission.

By default it connects to the Transmission RPC at 127.0.0.1:9091 without any username or password, but this can be changed in munin conf.

	[transmission_*]
	env.username your_username
	env.password your_password
	env.host some.otherhost.com
	env.port 9191
